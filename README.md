# ScrabbleWords

ScrabbleWords is an android application made for academic purposes as a University course project.  
The project was made using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and it was built on Java.  
The android application is a game of an Anagram puzzle. The player must find the correct words between 3-letter, 4-letter, or 5-letter words (which is the hard mode).  
The app is intended for children mostly, but in advanced modes, it can be played by older users.  

You can play it by installing the [apk file](https://github.com/DimitrisTK/ScrabbleWords/raw/master/ScrabbleWords.apk) on an android device.
